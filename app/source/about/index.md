# Hi. My name is Matt Tyndall. I build stuff.

I'm extremely passionate about building applications that simplify the way people interact with technology. I am particularly interested in web and mobile platforms. Recently I have been spending most of my time working With React/Redux and Ethereum. I'm a big proponent of the decentralized web and am excited to be a part of the blockchain revolution.

I also recently completed my Ethereum developer certification through [B9 Lab Academy](https://www.b9lab.com/). My final project was a crowdfunding dapp built with Truffle, React, Redux, and Solidity. You can check it out here: [https://github.com/tyndallm/crowdfund-dapp](https://github.com/tyndallm/crowdfund-dapp)
