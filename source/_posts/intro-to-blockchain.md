Before I jump into describing what a blockchain is, it may help to describe a problem that has existed since the begining of computer science known as the double spend problem. In the real world if I have an Apple and I hand it to you, you now have the Apple. In the digital world if I give you an file, you now have the file, but I also still have the file. The blockchain is a technology that allows for the transfer of digital ownership.

## The definition

....................................
A blockchain is a collection of technologies that establishes consensus over an untrusted network.
....................................

* merge of database and network
* all machines share the same version of reality
* data changes in one place, it changes everywhere
* single source of truth

### block + chain

The idea of the blockchain is based on the concept of a ledger. You can think of it as a book of transactions. For our purposes transactions are just a chunk of data.
